# compare_MLP_DNN
This code aims to evaluate the speed and accuracy of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in comparison to Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models. The analysis is conducted using the dataset from the Vehicle Detection System.

By implementing both DNN and MLP architectures, this code assesses their performance in terms of speed and accuracy for vehicle detection tasks. The DNN model utilizes a more complex and layered structure, while the MLP model represents a simpler neural network.

Through a comprehensive analysis of the Vehicle Detection System data, this code provides valuable insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of DNN and MLP models. This information can contribute to the advancement of vehicle detection systems by enabling developers to make informed decisions about which model is better suited for their specific requirements.
